						<p>Andromeda Software Development (abbreviated ASD) is a Greek demogroup that was formed in 1992. They produced a number of small intros and demos in the mid-1990s for the PC, most notably <span class="highlight">CounterFactual</span> (winner of the first Greek demo party ever, The Gardening 1995) and <span class="highlight">Beyond</span> (Placed 4th in The Gardening 1996). ASD was quiet for the following years until 2001, when they presented <span class="highlight">Cadence & Cascade</span> - their first accelerated demo - and won the Digital Nexus demoparty, held in Athens, Greece. From 2002 onwards, ASD started participating in major demoscene competitions, eventually winning the Assembly 2005 demo competition with <span class="highlight">Iconoclast</span>. ASD is not associated with the Norwegian demo group Andromeda, however, ASD collaborated with Archmage of Andromeda for the production of their 2007 Assembly demo competition winner <span class="highlight">Lifeforce</span>.</p>

						<p>In the accelerated era, ASD established themselves as a demogroup with an extremely distinctive style. Visually, their demos featured dynamic coherent flows of abstract visual elements subtly blending into each other in various unexpected ways, often to the point where the viewer wouldn't be able to distinguish the start- and endpoints of an effect. This led to many debates considering the demos, some viewers praise this type of design, while others consider this an unnecessary amalgam of otherwise unrelated visual effects. The two musicians of the group (aMUSiC and Leviathan, from Dreamchild) venture into the territory of progressive metal, akin to commercial bands such as Dream Theater or Liquid Tension Experiment. Their songs often feature live instruments, variating tempo and time signatures, constantly changing musical textures and a showcase of remarkable proficiency by the two composers.</p>
